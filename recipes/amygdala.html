           How to make amygdala at home! Make sure to read instructions thoroughly before starting to make sure you don't make something you already have.
       </p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <h4>For the Estrogen</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>androstenedione (or testosterone)</li>
       </ul>
      
    
       </ul>
       <h4>For the Androstenedione</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>cytochrome P450-dependent 17 alpha-hydroxylase (P450c17)</li>
           <li>17α-hydroxysteroids
           <li>For progesterone</li>
        
               <ul>
                   <li>cholesterol</li>
                   <li>or 20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol + <em>(cytochrome P450scc.)</em></li>
                    <!--Enyzyme catalysing oxidation of dihrdrochol-->
                   <li>or pregnenolone + 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/δ5-4-isomerase.</li>
                   <li>or progesterone</li>
                   
               </ul>
           
       </ul>
       
       <h4>For the drain beat</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>e <em>(flat)</em> major</li>
           <li>reverb</li>
           <li>normie noises</li>

       <!--Instructions start here-->
       <h3>Method</h3>
       
       <ol>
           <h4>Part 1: Androstenedione</h4><p><em>Note: If you already have androstenedione, part 1 is not a necessary step.</em></p> 
           <li>First to synthesis everything you have to start with cholesterol and convert it into 20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol, (oxidise it a few times.) </li>
           <li>Next convert the 20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol you have into pregnenolone, catalysing the reaction using cytochrome P450scc.
           <li>Once you have pregenelone it is pretty easy to get progesterone, some 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/δ5-4-isomerase will catalyse that reaction nicely.</li>

           <li>Use that fresh progesterone and metabolise it to 17 alpha-hydroxysteroids by a cytochrome P450-dependent 17 aplha hydroxylase (P450c17) enzyme.</li>

           <li>Now we can reuse that enxyme to catalyse the removal of the side chain of these 17 alpha-hydroxolated steroids to yield some androstenedione, (and dehydroepiandrosterone.)</li>
       
           <li>Androstenedione obtained!</li>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h4>Part 2: Estrogen</h4><p><em>Note: If you already have estrogen, part 1 and 2 are not necessary steps.</em></p>
            <li>Estrogen is very easy to make. Simply use the enzyme aromatase to convert your androstenedione into estrone.</li> 
            <li>Estrone is a form of estrogen but for the most feminine effect on the song you must convert it to estriadol.</li>
            <li>To get estriadol from estrone you must convert it using 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD).</li>
            <li>You can also produce estriadol from testosterone, by cycling it through a human circulatory system, some of it will be converted into estriadol.</li>
            <li>Estrogen obtained!</li>
            <p><em>PS: In case you have no testosterone you can convert androstenedione into testosterone using the same enzyme in Part 2 step 3: (17β-HSD). </em></p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h4>Part 3: The song</h4>
            <li> To make the beat set your keyboard into E key and mash together some keys until they sound good, play around a bit!</li>
            <li> Make sure to add loads of synth. If you think it's too much. Add more.</li>
            <li> Next add some random normie noises like some drums, don't worry the reverb will make the sound indiscernable but the unusual instrument - in drain at least- will make the sound edgy and unique.</li>
            <li>The penultimate step is to make <strong>everything</strong> reverb. Make it ricochet and bounce off the walls. Even inject some testosterone at this point to juice it up and juxtapose with the estrogen added next, it can amplify the estrogen nicely. But make sure not to use too much testosterone or the estrogen will be overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>Finally the <strong>SINGLE</strong> most important step in making this #draingang song into anything remotely like Amygdala, inject the estrogen (estriadol). Inject it deep into the varicose, steroid laden veins of your song. Accompanied with some well timed lyrics and moans, high pitched by the estrogen that make them bulge - but in a slightly more feminine way.</li>

        <h3>Final Note</h3>
        <p>Some of this may not be right so I am sorry. Unfortunately I'm not a synthetic biologist and I couldn't describe every single step involved. Additionally some of the processes I mentioned are what occurs in natural synthesis of the proteins and some cells are involved too that I didn't mention. Artificial synthesis is most likely done differently but it is what it is. </p>
